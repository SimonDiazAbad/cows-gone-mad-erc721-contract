# Cows Gone Mad Solidity Project

The CGM collection has 9999 NFTs that commemorate the lives of 9999 cows who survived the great culling during the Mad Cow Disease outbreak. MetaPolyclinic specifically selected the Polygon blockchain to mint the CGM Collection due to the platformâ€™s scalability, high transaction throughput and supportive community.

### Available commands
```
# Install Dependencies
$ npm install

# Compile (Build) Contracts Only
$ truffle compile

# Run Blockchain Locally
$ truffle develop

# Run Tests
$ truffle test

# Run Deploy Script
$ truffle migrate
```

## Project Structure
This is a truffle javascript project composed of contracts, tests and migrations.
Migrations folders contain the deploy scripts.

This a template hardhat typescript project composed of contracts, tests, and deploy instructions that provides a great starting point for developers to quickly get up and running and deploying smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Tests
Tests are found in the ./test/ folder. No additional keys are required to run the tests.

Contract coverage is not checked.

## Contracts
Solidity smart contracts are found in ./contracts/

./contracts/CowsGoneMad_Mock.sol contract is a mock contract that is used for testing purposes.

## Deploy
Deploy script can be found in the ./migrations/1_deploy_contracts.js.

Important: If deploying to testnet or mainnet, make sure to adjust the deploy script to deploy the CowsGoneMad contract and not the Mock contract. Then add the correct arguments into the constructor for your project.

Configure truffle-config.js by 

Rename ./.env.example to ./.env in the project root. To add the mnemonic string of a deployer account, assign the following variables

MNEMONIC=...

MUMBAI_API_KEY=...
