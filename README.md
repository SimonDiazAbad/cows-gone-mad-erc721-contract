## Cows Gone Mad Solidity Project

The CGM collection has 9999 NFTs that commemorate the lives of 9999 cows who survived the great culling during the Mad Cow Disease outbreak. MetaPolyclinic specifically selected the Polygon blockchain to mint the CGM Collection due to the platformâ€™s scalability, high transaction throughput and supportive community.

## Project Structure
This is a truffle javascript project 

This a template hardhat typescript project composed of contracts, tests, and deploy instructions that provides a great starting point for developers to quickly get up and running and deploying smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

Tests
Tests are found in the ./test/ folder. ./test/shared/ contains various test helpers. No additional keys are required to run the tests.

Both positive and negative cases are covered, and test coverage is 100%.

Contracts
Solidity smart contracts are found in ./contracts/

./contracts/mocks folder contains contracts mocks that are used for testing purposes.

Deploy
Deploy script can be found in the deploy.ts folder.

Rename ./.env.example to ./.env in the project root. To add the private key of a deployer account, assign the following variables

PRIVATE_KEY=...
TOKEN_ADDRESS=...
example:

$ npm run deploy -- mumbai
